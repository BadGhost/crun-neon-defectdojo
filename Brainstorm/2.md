Of course, I can help with that. Based on the error log and the repository you've provided, it looks like you're dealing with a common issue when setting up a new **Django** environment.  
The error message **relation "django\_site" does not exist** indicates that the application is trying to access a database table that hasn't been created yet. This usually happens when the initial database migrations, which create all the necessary tables for Django's core features, have not been run.  
Let's break down the problem and the solution.

### **The Problem**

The traceback in your error log points to a failure during the login process, specifically when trying to access the django\_site table. This table is part of **Django's "sites" framework**, which allows you to run multiple websites from the same project. Even if you aren't using this feature, it's enabled by default and requires its database tables to be in place.  
Looking at your modules/cloud\_run/main.tf file, you have an environment variable DD\_INITIALIZE set to "true". This suggests an initialization step should be happening, but it appears the database migrations aren't being executed correctly, or the application is starting before the migrations are complete.

### **The Solution**

To fix this, you need to ensure that the **Django database migrations** are run before the application starts accepting requests. Since you are using a Docker-based deployment with a separate initializer container, the ideal place to handle this is in your deployment process.  
Here’s a step-by-step guide to resolving the issue:

#### **Step 1: Manually Run Migrations (for immediate testing)**

If you want to quickly verify that migrations are the issue, you can run them manually. First, you'll need to connect to your **Cloud Run** instance. While a direct shell is not available, you can use gcloud run services logs read to check the logs and see what is happening during startup.  
To apply the migrations, you would typically run a command like this from within your application's environment:

Bash

python manage.py migrate

Since you have an initializer container, this command should be part of its entry point script. It appears the current initializer is not running migrations as expected.

#### **Step 2: Correct the Deployment Process**

The deployment.md file outlines the deployment steps, including applying the **Terraform configuration**. It’s crucial to ensure that after the infrastructure is up, the database is properly initialized.  
The docs/troubleshooting.md also provides helpful diagnostic commands. Running the health check script from this file can help confirm if other parts of your setup are working correctly.

#### **Step 3: Verify the Initializer**

Your setup includes an initializer container, which is the correct approach. The purpose of this container is to run one-time tasks like database migrations. Ensure that the Dockerfile.initializer and the associated entry point script correctly execute the migrate command.  
If the initializer is not working as expected, you may need to modify its startup command in your **Terraform** configuration to explicitly run the migrations.

#### **Step 4: Check for Race Conditions**

Sometimes, the web container (uwsgi) starts before the initializer has finished its job. To prevent this, you can add a startup delay or a health check in your uwsgi container that waits for the database to be ready before starting the web server.

### **Summary**

The root cause of your error is a missing database table, which can be resolved by running **Django's database migrations**. By ensuring your initializer container correctly executes the python manage.py migrate command before your web application starts, you can solve this problem and get your **DefectDojo** instance running smoothly.

# Project Summary: DefectDojo on Google Cloud Run

## Overview

This project provides a complete, production-ready Terraform infrastructure solution for deploying DefectDojo (security vulnerability management platform) on Google Cloud Platform using serverless technologies.

## Architecture Highlights

### ✅ Security-First Design
- **Cloud Armor WAF**: Comprehensive web application firewall with OWASP rules
- **IP Allowlisting**: Restricts access to specified source IP addresses  
- **Managed SSL/TLS**: Automatic certificate provisioning and renewal
- **Secret Management**: All sensitive data stored in Google Secret Manager
- **Least-Privilege IAM**: Dedicated service accounts with minimal permissions

### ✅ Serverless & Cost-Effective
- **Cloud Run**: Scale-to-zero serverless containers (pay only when used)
- **Global Load Balancer**: Enterprise-grade load balancing with DDoS protection
- **Neon PostgreSQL**: Free-tier serverless database
- **Automatic Scaling**: Handles traffic spikes without manual intervention

### ✅ Production-Ready Features
- **High Availability**: Multi-zone deployment with automatic failover
- **Monitoring**: Integrated with Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated database backups and versioned file storage
- **SSL Domains**: Uses sslip.io for automatic wildcard SSL certificates

## Key Features Implemented

### 🔐 Comprehensive Security
1. **Network Security**
   - Cloud Armor with custom security policies
   - IP-based access control (single source IP)
   - Rate limiting (100 requests/minute per IP)
   - Protection against XSS, SQL injection, and file inclusion attacks

2. **Application Security**
   - All secrets stored in Secret Manager
   - Service account with minimal IAM permissions
   - Container isolation with Cloud Run
   - Encrypted data at rest and in transit

3. **SSL/TLS Security**
   - Automatic SSL certificate management
   - TLS 1.2+ enforcement
   - HTTP to HTTPS automatic redirect

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Components
1. **Compute**: Cloud Run with DefectDojo + Redis containers
2. **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (free tier, serverless)
3. **Storage**: Cloud Storage bucket for media files
4. **Networking**: Global HTTPS Load Balancer with static IP
5. **Security**: Cloud Armor WAF with custom policies
6. **Secrets**: Google Secret Manager for sensitive configuration

### 💰 Cost Optimization
- **Predictable base cost**: ~$24-40/month
- **Scale-to-zero**: No compute costs when not in use
- **Managed services**: Reduced operational overhead
- **Free database tier**: Neon PostgreSQL free plan
